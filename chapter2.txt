So the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to cd into my desktop. And here I'm going to create a

new directory called Story. Then I'm going to cd into this Story directory and if I show you with ls you

can see that it's completely empty.

And similarly inside Finder I can show you the same thing.

So let's go ahead and create some text files.

So I'm going to use touch to create a file called chapter1.txt.

And then I'm going to open chapter1.txt and you can either do this by simply writing open and it'll open

it inside the default application which is TextEdit on a Mac,

alternatively you can use a text editor within the terminal, for example Vim.

Now this is only for people who are really familiar with this.

So it's totally up to you what you decide to use.

But if you are not familiar with using terminal based editors, then it's probably a good idea to just

stick with the open command and use TextEdit.

So let's go ahead and open chapter1 and let's write something inside, shall we?

Okay, so that's my masterpiece done.

Going to go ahead and hit save

and I'm going to quit TextEdit.

So that was our first chapter done.

So now let's create a Git local repository and start tracking some of these file changes. So to initialize

Git we simply write git init.

And as you can see it's initialized and empty Git repository inside the story directory.

Now if you have a look inside Finder you actually can't see this .git at all.

But as we learned before

if you use ls -a

you can see all the hidden files and you can see that .git is right there and it's going to be used

to track all your changes, to commit your changes and to perform version control.

So we're currently inside the story directory and you can also call this the working directory.

So as I mentioned before, using Git and learning about version control it comes with some of its own terminology

and language.
